Timestamp	Nearly two decades ago, the U.S. closed its border to Canada entirely following the 9/11 attacks. Perishable food spoiled as trucks waited days to cross.	In these incredibly destabilizing times, it’s imperative that some economic activity continues.	The threat posed by COVID-19 has made this extreme measure necessary.	But as Canada and the U.S. implement the new policy, border guards and travellers alike will be confused about who is an essential worker and what kind of crossings are allowed.	When the policy takes effect, cross-border shoppers and tourists will be turned away, as border crossings are restricted to essential workers, truckers and others who facilitate trade between the two countries.

Trudeau’s government, locked in a diplomatic spat with Saudi Arabia since August, has waffled on whether to suspend, or somehow intervene in, a deal to sell armoured vehicles manufactured by General Dynamics Land Systems Canada to the kingdom.	“We can use export permits and we can make a determination on that,” Trudeau said, “but at the same time, I do not want to leave Canadians holding a billion-dollar bill because we’re trying to move forward on doing the right thing.	Khadr said, “My faith has been a very big part of my survival and I’ve had a lot of good people around me.

The wastes at Chalk River are the size of the Titanic – but will grow to one million cubic metres by decommissioning more than 100 buildings and bringing in radioactive waste from Manitoba and elsewhere over the next 50 years.	They don’t meet the standards of the International Atomic Energy Agency, and they don’t make sense.	What makes Canada stand out in the world is unlimited natural beauty: miles of unspoiled forests, lakes, rivers, prairies and tundra.	Radioactive particles have half-lives of up to millions of years: in human terms, forever.

Pompeo made the announcement of his certification in a statement, saying that the two Gulf countries were “undertaking demonstrable actions to reduce the risk of harm to civilians.”	American no-strike lists were first shared  -  and flouted  -  under the Obama administration.	“Saudi Arabia and the UAE are strong counterterrorism partners,” says the memo, citing the expulsion of Al Qaeda’s affiliate from the Yemeni port city of Mukalla in May 2016, cutting off “a significant source of revenue of the terrorist group.”	“This administration is doubling down on its failed policy of literally fueling the world’s largest humanitarian crisis,” said Scott Paul, Oxfam America’s humanitarian policy lead.

I understand the feeling some hold that there is a double standard when it comes to terrorism in Canadian law.

Acts of terrorism do cause visceral reactions: fear, terror, anxiety, etc.	It is possible for someone to target another based on gender, ethnicity, creed or race but it is not necessary for there to be an underlying political, ideological or religious motivation.	Well, there isn’t a lot of trust out there,” said Chris Bloomer, president and CEO of the Canadian Energy Pipelines Association.	“This bill is as damaging to the Canadian economy as any piece of legislation that we’ve seen in a decade,” said Tim McMillan, president and CEO of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers.	“Our big fear is it gets amended to the point where it’s a dog’s breakfast and it doesn’t work for anybody.”	Ottawa has said it was considering chipping in money to help, but has not laid out firm plans.

A campaign aide said Biden has privately contacted Hill to share “his regret for what she endured and his admiration for everything she has done to change the culture around sexual harassment in this country.”	A handful of other women have made similar claims, though none has alleged sexual misconduct.	That was the spur for him to launch a third presidential bid, Biden said, noting Trump’s comments that there were some “very fine people” on both sides of the violent encounter, which left one woman dead.	“I only hope you have the intelligence, long in doubt, to wage a successful primary campaign,” Trump said.

There never was a democracy yet, that did not commit suicide.”	“Democracy never lasts long,” Adams reflected in an 1814 letter.	Whether intentional or not, Trump has learned how to manipulate the attention economy of modern society by successfully focusing huge amounts of daily media attention on himself.	In most functioning democracies, the people are bystanders much of the time anyway.	Reflecting on that possibility in his 1985 book, “Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business,” cultural critic Neil Postman wrote, “As he”  -  Huxley  -  “saw it, people will come to love their oppression, to adore the technologies that undo their capacities to think.”	“There are many parts of American society and politics that still work and democracy is still quite vibrant at the state and local level, though it’s clear that with regards to the major issues of our time – such as climate change and inequality – our institutions are unable to respond,” Runciman writes.	“Republican candidates lost ground in counties that were adversely affected by retaliatory tariffs, but saw no discernible gains in counties where workers were disproportionately protected by new U.S. tariffs.”	Trade wars may be “easy to win,” according to U.S. President Donald Trump, but congressional seats?	That means Canadian policymakers will be pleased to hear the tariffs worked exactly as they intended.	Interestingly, the study found no political benefits for Republicans from the original tariffs unveiled by Trump in the beginning of his trade war.	In April 2018, China unleashed retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods like aluminum, pork, and soybeans, in response to Trump’s global tariffs on steel and aluminum.	“These findings suggest that both the trade war and health care policy contributed meaningfully to the 2018 ‘Blue Wave,’ in which Republicans lost a total of 40 House seats,” the paper reads.	“I’m happy for the families and the witnesses that would have had to have testified at a preliminary hearing,” he said.	“I think the sooner we can put this to rest and the families have answers I think the better it is for folks to understand that.”	“I’m happy for the families and the witnesses that would have had to have testified at a preliminary hearing,” he said.

For the past week, Hong Kong has been taking another step toward figuring out exactly what it is.	This worked out for 20 years, but now the Hong Kong citizenry’s contempt for what it regards as backward, loutish mainlanders is turning into fear.	Britain did not have a very good hand to play in negotiating the handover of the colony: Whitehall’s strategy, embodied in Hong Kong’s Basic Law, was to negotiate wide “democratic” suffrage, as a means of belatedly inculcating democratic habits, while conceding a Communist Chinese veto of top personnel in the local government.

We know our system is hopelessly inefficient.	Because the young mother in question can’t get mental help for the stress caused by not getting physical help, Osler says, “Other than psychiatric care, mental health coverage isn’t in the Canada Health Act, but should it be?	Hope it falls from the sky or something.	According to the Post, “while the CMA doesn’t have a position on whether the Canada Health Act should be changed, Osler said it’s time for Canadians to have an ‘open and frank discussion’ about issues in and around the legislation.”	With health devouring over 40 per cent of program spending everywhere and people still can’t get doctors, a bunch of expensive new obligations is exactly what it needs.	“The issues with counting the data correctly and doing that consistently over the years  -  what it reveals is lack of empathy at many levels.”	“What really changes history, what really changes policymaking is not to provide more scientific data so legislators can be more enlightened,” he said.	“I dance,” she said.

This is the border crisis that Ocasio-Cortez, and many of her exemplary colleagues, plus her trumpeters in the press, (a) denied up until a month ago was a crisis and (b) claimed that the idea that it was a crisis was just a trumped-up (pun absolutely deliberate) false alarm by America’s would-be-tyrant president.

I use that word because that is what an administration that creates concentration camps is … Never Again means something.”	Another ignoramus, also a Congresswoman, “argued” as there were “camps” on the southern border and people were “concentrated” in them  -  so, there you have it, they are concentration camps.	“The U.S. is running concentration camps on our southern border, and that is exactly what they are,” was her opening salvo, and to eliminate any confusion about what she meant and how strongly she meant it, she continued: “I don’t use those words lightly.	“Do not give these offenders the benefit of the doubt.”	“They are very scared and they don’t know what to expect,” Murrell said.	“Hit that call button .	said Hudson, who is an attorney and represented rape victims in New York.

And in the case of those who describe themselves as “ordinary people,” I believe it does.	At some point between Canada 149 and Canada 150, a large bulk of our intelligentsia lurched suddenly from fretting that the world wasn’t sufficiently appreciative of our kinder, gentler multi-culti middle-power awesomeness, to fretting that the world  -  and, more importantly, Canadians themselves  -  were getting excessively hammered on Trudeaupian Kool-Aid.

Williams, who also has a civilian job at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base outside the city, said he had watched the news of the El Paso, Texas, mass shooting earlier on Saturday.	“Obviously, we’re working very hard to give the public an answer as to what the motivation might have been.”	“This is $22,000 for doing what I’m already doing. That’s pretty huge to me as a farmer.”	“It is the only action we can take today whose impact matches the scale of the problem,” he said.	We don’t really care how you get there.	Thus the carbon is “captured” underground.	Russell Hedrick, a regenerative grower who farms non-GMO and heirloom corn, soy, barley, oats and triticale in Hickory, N.C. has been measuring the carbon in his 1,000 acres and the best he’s ever done is 1.5 tons per acre.	“It is the only action we can take today whose impact matches the scale of the problem,” he said.	Wong-Ward writes she was surprised to discover that palliative care  -  which, like many Canadians, she identified as meaning “you are about to die”  -  is more about guidance and protection for patients “who are coping with the most difficult time of their lives,” which may or may not include the prospect of imminent death.	Furthermore, in assessing what happens in countries or other jurisdictions where euthanasia becomes legal, it is clear to me that citizens with poor quality of life who demand greater resources for “assisted living” rather than opting for “dying with dignity” are looked at with a certain impatience and disrespect.

What comes across in Foley’s story is institutional insensitivity to his individual needs, and  -  in my interpretation -  resentment that he is complaining about substandard care, and worse, demanding to live optimally, rather than die to validate the theory that death is, or should be, preferable to radically diminished physical independence.

The research into the question of Warren’s dual eligibility reflects the political affinity that has long existed between the two  -  an affinity that was dealt a setback over the past week, as the pair clashed over the contents of a year-old private conversation.	“What I did say that night was that Donald Trump is a sexist, a racist, and a liar who would weaponize whatever he could,” Sanders said.	Sanders could have allowed that since he had said that “Trump is a sexist … who would weaponize whatever he could,” he could understand how Warren may have inferred that he didn’t think a woman could overcome such obstacles.	“What I did say that night was that Donald Trump is a sexist, a racist, and a liar who would weaponize whatever he could,” Sanders said.	On Monday, it finally did, with CNN’s M.J. Lee reporting that according to four sources  -  described as “two people Warren spoke with directly soon after the encounter, and two people familiar with the meeting”  -  Sanders had told Warren, according to CNN’s paraphrasing, that “he did not believe a woman could win.”	“What I did say that night was that Donald Trump is a sexist, a racist, and a liar who would weaponize whatever he could,” Sanders said.	This all seems a bit relaxed for the midst of a rapidly spreading deadly pandemic, no?	This is a major failure by our federal officials.	Instead, my family and I had the fastest, most pain-free customs experience of our lives.	Instead, my family and I had the fastest, most pain-free customs experience of our lives.	On Saturday night, I landed at Toronto’s Pearson International Airport, returning home from Orlando, Fla., after a 10-day holiday.	“We have enhanced screening measures in place at all international airports, as well as land/rail/marine ports of entry,” Public Safety Minister Bill Blair tweeted last week.	We had no idea why he chose to stay there, but he did.”	“A lot of people will miss the fact that he’s no longer with us,” she said.	“WHAAATTTT?????	We had no idea why he chose to stay there, but he did.”	Before his arrival, there were no ducks on the remote island, commonly referred to as “The Rock” for its lack of wetlands, lakes, ponds, rivers and streams.	“A lot of people will miss the fact that he’s no longer with us,” she said.
